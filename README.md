A fun and interactive wordle with words from the Meriam Webster Dictonary inspiration from the Wordle Website New York Times. 

Includes a fun way to play the application and provides the user the option to quit and see the scret word at any time.


 
By default, this has the Administrator permission checked. If you're using Wordle for games, you should keep it checked.
